# Algorithms Lab 2018

This repository contains my solutions for the course Algorithms Lab at ETH Zurich. The solutions were written in a limited amount of time to simulate the exam's conditions. Therefore, the coding style and clarity might not always be consistent.

Almost all of these solutions give 100 points on the online judge. Nevertheless, it is still possible to write shorter and better solutions to some of the problem.
